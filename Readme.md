## GameBoy Emulator in CPP
- I wanted to improve my understanding and handling of bit operations and so I did this project.
- My understanding of how opcodes work through translations inside an emulation was rudimentary at best. Only now, I feel like I can think about the execution of code correctly at the lowest level. 
- The emulator currently does not hold Audio because it's completely outside my understanding currently, but I am trying to nail it down. 
- Let's hope I learn more.
